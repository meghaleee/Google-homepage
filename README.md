Google homepage project by The Odin Project.<br>
This is the first time, since I started learning HTML, CSS, that I have made using minimum references.<br>
I also tried to minimize the amount of CSS properties so I didn't end up having unused properties. <br>
There are still padding and positioning issues but in future, once I learn and practise them more frequently, I would come back and correct them.
